    Any instances which have previously been marked as
    non compliant with tag policies, that are now compliant
    should be unmarked as non-compliant.

    Stop all non autoscaling group instances previously marked
    for stoppage by today's date, and schedule termination in
    2 days. Also verify that they continue to not meet tagging
    policies.
